# TokenKey

Welcome to Tokenkey, HowTo!

[Magic](https://magic.link) makes it super simple to provide users with secure, non-custodial wallets while also supporting third party wallets. This NFT Starter Kit illustrates how to integrate [Magic Connect](https://magic.link/connect) with a basic NFT site that allows users to mint and view NFTs from a particular NFT collection.

## New to Magic and/or Web3?

We've got plenty of resources to help you get started on your journey!

- Our [**Frontend Guide**](./frontend/README.md) is a great place to start! It walks through the basics of this repo, the Magic SDK, and interacting with the blockchain from a client.
- [Magic Connect documentation](https://magic.link/docs/connect/overview) is another great resource for understanding what Magic has to offer.

In addition to the Frontend Guide, this repository stores the code we used to generate the Ethereum contract for the NFT collection. Take a look at the `contract` directory as part of getting started with your Web3 journey! We'll update this repository with a guide for the on-chain portion soon.

We'll also be releasing more guides, templates, and tutorials over time so be sure to follow along here and on [our blog](https://magic.link/blogs)!

## Already know what you're doing?
